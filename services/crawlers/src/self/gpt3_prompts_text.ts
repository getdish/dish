Solid Vietnamese restaurant with pricing that's almost on par with Orange County! Due to the current pandemic, we could only do takeout, but the interior was very spacious looking! The menu is extensive, with lots of protein combinations for the staple dishes like vermicelli (b√∫n), pho, broken rice (com tam), and beef stew (bo kho). Seriously, is the SF version of Pho Lu (in Westminster, CA) or nah?! We shared the vermicelli with grilled chicken and shrimp ($10.75). The fish sauce was flavorful, albeit not spicy. The grilled chicken had a nice char to it and was juicy, plus the noodles were still warm when we got home 30 minutes later to eat it. Overall, definitely would order again to share, with an appetizer for a light dinner. Next time I'll skip the nearby boba places and get my boba here because their fruit shakes (including durian!!!) look delicious and c'mon, you know Viet places only use fresh, real fruit for them! Customer Service (3.5/5) Overall, customer service is okay.

The witty guide says: Servers will ignore you, who cares? The Durian Boba is so good it causes mid-life crises 10 years early. The Number 1 with Spring Rolls is so good you'll cry. It reminds  of a previous life living in the paddy fields of North Vietnam, wind in my hair, sun-drenched visions of rolling hills. Such is the power of the food here. Though  having to ask for water more than once might not seem great, that's just because they're so busy actually making food. And at the end of the day, you can just rely on the quality of the food here.

Hands down my favorite taco joint in San Francisco (pre & post COVID). Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is one of the few, if not the only restaurant in SF that serves birria tacos -- and they are delicious! The beef stew meat and broth on the side go so well together (remember to add the cheese!) The flavors are intense but not too overwhelming. Another plus: these are HUGE tacos; I can only eat 3 at a time.  I've been here pre-COVID, and it was packed. You order at the counter first then wait for a table to open up. You have to strategize and be quick but still be respectful of others (no table stealing!!!)  -- absolutely not a time to be shy.  They only do to-go orders during the pandemic. I called in my order and it was ready in 15 minutes. They throw in complimentary chips and salsa with your order. I definitely will be placing more orders until the shelter in place is lifted.  PS: They also have sangria to-go now. It was perfectly concocted!
"""

The witty guide says: If you've never tried birria tacos you don't know what flavor is. So big and juicy you'll need a bib. Plus, sangria to go is a no-brainer. There's a bit of learning curve figuring how to order - go to the counter first and try not to steal anybody else's table! But 15 mins to get the order ready, they must be wizards. We give this place a double thumbs up, if for no other reason than the complimentary ships and salsa. We could talk about this place for hours, but just thinking about it makes you hungry.
