Yes, this truck is far better than Chipotle, but that's a low bar.  Yes, it's better than those multi-ethnic delis in the FiDi that happen to offer burritos as one of many food options, but also another low bar.  No, it doesn't even compare to a solid burrito at any reputable joint in the Mission.  It's just "OK", hence the 3-star rating.  Also, it's annoying that they charge a credit card fee; it's in fine print at the bottom of the menu so you may not even see it as you order your burrito from the top of the menu.

The guide says: Better than Chipotle and the delis in FiDi, but that's a low bar. Not as good as any joints in the Mission. Watch for the credit card fee.

Solid Vietnamese restaurant with pricing almost on par with Orange County! We could only do takeout, but the interior is very spacious looking! The menu is extensive, lots of protein combinations for the staple dishes like vermicelli (bún), pho, broken rice (com tam), and beef stew (bo kho). Seriously, is the SF version of Pho Lu (in Westminster, CA) or nah?! We shared the vermicelli with grilled chicken and shrimp ($10.75). The fish sauce was flavorful, albeit not spicy. The grilled chicken had a nice char to it, the noodles were still warm when we got home 30 minutes later. Overall, definitely would order again. Next time I'll skip the nearby boba places and get my boba here because their fruit shakes (including durian!) look delicious and c'mon, you know Viet places only use fresh, real fruit for them! Customer Service (3.5/5) Overall, customer service is okay.

The guide says: Servers will ignore you, but who cares? The Durian Boba and The Number 1 with Spring Rolls are the real deal. A real gem of a spot. Ok customer service, have to ask for water more than once.

Hands down my favorite taco joint in San Francisco. I think this is one of the few, if not the only restaurant in SF that serves birria tacos -- they are delicious! The beef stew meat and broth on the side go so well together (remember to add the cheese!) The flavors are intense but not too overwhelming. Another plus: these are HUGE tacos; I can only eat 3 at a time. It's always packed. You order at the counter first then wait for a table to open up. You have to strategize and be quick but still be respectful of others - absolutely not a time to be shy. They throw in complimentary chips and salsa with your order. PS: They also have sangria to-go now. It was perfectly concocted!
"""

The guide says: Birria tacos = big flavor (remember to add cheese). Sangria to go also a no-brainer. Go to the counter first, don't steal a table! Orders come fast, plus free chips and salsa.
