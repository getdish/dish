Solid Vietnamese restaurant with pricing that's almost on par with Orange County! Due to the current pandemic, we could only do takeout, but the interior was very spacious looking! The menu is extensive, with lots of protein combinations for the staple dishes like vermicelli (b√∫n), pho, broken rice (com tam), and beef stew (bo kho). Seriously, is the SF version of Pho Lu (in Westminster, CA) or nah?! We shared the vermicelli with grilled chicken and shrimp ($10.75). The fish sauce was flavorful, albeit not spicy. The grilled chicken had a nice char to it and was juicy, plus the noodles were still warm when we got home 30 minutes later to eat it. Overall, definitely would order again to share, with an appetizer for a light dinner. Next time I'll skip the nearby boba places and get my boba here because their fruit shakes (including durian!!!) look delicious and c'mon, you know Viet places only use fresh, real fruit for them! Customer Service (3.5/5) Overall, customer service is okay. The servers don't really interact with you besides taking your order. The only thing is that they're usually busy so expect to ask for whatever you need a few times. I've definitely been here a few times and had to ask 3-4 times for some cold water before either receiving it and in one case not getting it at all. Besides that though, the pho and fresh spring rolls generally comes out in less than 5 minutes. No matter how busy it gets, the food always come fast. Not too sure about how quickly the rice plates come out though. Food/taste (5/5) I always get the number 1 and sometimes with extra noodles. It just hits the spot and its a huge plus that it comes out in 5 minutes. The fresh spring rolls with shrimp are pretty tasty and pair well with the peanut sauce consistency. No matter how many times I've come here the consistency and quality of the food has never changed so huge props to them.

Hands down my favorite taco joint in San Francisco (pre & post COVID). Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is one of the few, if not the only restaurant in SF that serves birria tacos -- and they are delicious! The beef stew meat and broth on the side go so well together (remember to add the cheese!) The flavors are intense but not too overwhelming. Another plus: these are HUGE tacos; I can only eat 3 at a time.  I've been here pre-COVID, and it was packed. You order at the counter first then wait for a table to open up. You have to strategize and be quick but still be respectful of others (no table stealing!!!)  -- absolutely not a time to be shy.  They only do to-go orders during the pandemic. I called in my order and it was ready in 15 minutes. They throw in complimentary chips and salsa with your order. I definitely will be placing more orders until the shelter in place is lifted.  PS: They also have sangria to-go now. It was perfectly concocted!

A witty, silly guidebook says: If you've never tried birria tacos you don't know what flavor is. So big and juicy you'll need a bib. Plus, sangria to go: no-brainer.

Stopped by Nara on a chilly, breezy evening in San Francisco. Made a reservation for 2, and we were seated immediately! Longest part of getting settled in at Nara was finding a parking spot -- luckily SF was not (as) crowded as it normally can get, and I was able to find parking within 15 minutes. Speaking of COVID, the tables for parties of 2 or 4 were spaced out nicely with dividers between parties to get that extra peace of mind. Although I wasn't a huge fan of the shared soy sauce bottle, I really did appreciate the kindhearted service and support we received from the staff throughout, both about fish expertise and about general logistics (napkins, water, etc.) NOW -- onto the food. All that being said, my favorite was the Truffle appetizer, which went down smoothly without any soy or wasabi. YUM. The sashimi and sushi platter were plentiful (albeit $30 for each) but taste on the classics like salmon and tuna was just not there for me. The Korean halibut was meaty and different but I likely wouldn't try it again. The Dragon Roll was as expected, nothing special there but hit the spot! May return here again when this is all over :)

A witty, silly guidebook says: The most authentic? Nah. The freshest fish? Ehh. Hard to park, but to be honest, worth it just for the Truffle appetizer.
