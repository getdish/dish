Solid Vietnamese restaurant with pricing that's almost on par with Orange County! Due to the current pandemic, we could only do takeout, but the interior was very spacious looking! The menu is extensive, with lots of protein combinations for the staple dishes like vermicelli (b√∫n), pho, broken rice (com tam), and beef stew (bo kho). Seriously, is the SF version of Pho Lu (in Westminster, CA) or nah?! We shared the vermicelli with grilled chicken and shrimp ($10.75). The fish sauce was flavorful, albeit not spicy. The grilled chicken had a nice char to it, the noodles were still warm when we got home 30 minutes later. Overall, definitely would order again. Next time I'll skip the nearby boba places and get my boba here because their fruit shakes (including durian!) look delicious and c'mon, you know Viet places only use fresh, real fruit for them! Customer Service (3.5/5) Overall, customer service is okay.

The guide says: Servers will ignore you, but who cares? The Durian Boba is a must. The Number 1 with Spring Rolls are the real deal. A real gem of a spot, though having to ask for water more than once might not seem great, that's just because they're so busy actually making food.

Hands down my favorite taco joint in San Francisco. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is one of the few, if not the only restaurant in SF that serves birria tacos -- and they are delicious! The beef stew meat and broth on the side go so well together (remember to add the cheese!) The flavors are intense but not too overwhelming. Another plus: these are HUGE tacos; I can only eat 3 at a time. It's always packed. You order at the counter first then wait for a table to open up. You have to strategize and be quick but still be respectful of others - absolutely not a time to be shy. They throw in complimentary chips and salsa with your order. PS: They also have sangria to-go now. It was perfectly concocted!
"""

The guide says: If you've never tried birria tacos you don't know what flavor is. So big and juicy you'll need a bib. Sangria to go: no-brainer. Go to the counter first, don't steal a table! Orders come fast, plus free chips and salsa.
