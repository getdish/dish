- onPress extraction + media query extraction have most speed up
- bug with props after spread not applying, make them deopt:
  - <VStack {...baseStyle} cursor="default" /> wont be right rn
- have seen bugs with <Spacer flex /> and <VStack fullscreen />
- make pressStyle override hoverStyle always
- activeStyle may be desirable...
- <Image /> // harder than seems RN does some werid stuff with cover/etc
- spacing
  - SmallButton good example case of constant
- hoverStyle/pressStyle (spread + constant too - TagButton, DishView)
  - final step is hoverStyle={{ color: x, ...parent.hoverStyle, }}
- pass in config to be able to create static extracted easily within web
  - OverlayLinkButton
- SmallCircleButton case spreads
- Circle, EmojiButton, LinearGradient, VoteButton
- LinkButton - getting this to just extract styles would be big
  - just needs to tell compiler _never_ to go to just <div />
- onPressIn/onPressOut etc can all be converted to inline functions still as divs (HomeAutocompleteBackground, SearchLocationButton, etc)
- // TODO WHY SCALE NOT WORKING???
- Link - can maybe fully extract, if we can just run the actual component and then return the results???
- CSS variables for color!
