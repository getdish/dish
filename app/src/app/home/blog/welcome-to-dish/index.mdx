When you subscribe to Spotify, you aren't just paying to listen to music. You're _voting for the Spotify model_. Why do communities fail? Growth, spam, trolls, initial audience, leaders, capitalism or September?

What I want to get away from ultimately is **processes that abuse their users**, which seems especially prominent in advertising and early stage VC companies.

I want Dishers to be proud of the idea, the product,and to feel like they have something long-term they can contribute to to make _their hometown_, within _their favorite cuisines_, better.

As tech matures, we have more room for personality, experience, interaction. But it doesn't always move forward.

Look at this progression in social: Usenet, AIM, Myspace, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok. Some mediums allowed profuse personalization, and then Facebook came. But with Snapchat and TikTok, we're seeing "zany-ness" come back.

I'm hoping for a similar one here, with "local search" (blegh), or it really should be called: a community-powered guide to the world.

I want people to be able to share playlists of their favorite nights out, beautiful countryside trips, top coffee shops to work at, and best places to catch a sunset. We lost something special in the shutter of FourSquare, but we can do even better, and Snapchat and TikTok show in part that personality, sociality, and fun matter.

### Aim high

This will make more sense after the next section, but I want it first because it stands on it's own, and it's easier to agree with.

People pay for quality. And paying for things often aligns you better with the company.

> obligatory _"if youre not paying for it, you're the product"_ quote

Dish will explore some sort of "Prime membership" type deal, with a free tier that still gets you as good an experience as what's already out there.

It's not just about making the customer happier, it's also about setting a benchmark: I want to make something great, and if it is, then people will pay a small amount to have that, and vote to maintain it.

### Beneficent bullies

Ok, so Google really does look evil. Steadily increasing ad cost, steadily decreasing ad pay, steadily increasing ads, steadily increasing inlining information, steady picking off of competitors, and despite all this, a declining quality of index in many areas (how often does a site filter like "site:reddit.com" _significantly improve_ your results), Ad-blocking-prevention, baking tracking into Chrome, inlining content, AMP, Google Play Services, etc etc.

And if the AI misinterprets your content as "hateful": no trial, no vote, just years of life lost and the Algorithm all the way down.

Many say, "we need to decentralize!", and I sympathize, I do. But decentralization is too hard to do at the moment. And solving two hard problems is almost never possible. So for now, it seems the antidote to a Big Evil Company (BEC) will just have to be Big Amazing Companies (BAC) until proven otherwise. To define:

- The customers of a BAC company are primarily being persuaded to keep purchasing with the BAC.

Meanwhile...

- The customers of a BEC are being tracked and analyzed in order to sell you on many other companies.

Evil companies make it harder to find good information because their entire revenue stream - advertising - is predicated on that. If they help you out along the way, it's only in the way that poison is best covered in yogurt.

Do we have to have poison to eat Yogurt? Maybe we can just pay for Yogurt.

**The highest paying bidder is a terrible, terrible algorithm for finding good things**. It's ironic that two of our biggest information finding/sharing companies rely on this entirely.

### Communities know best, but need tending

This one isn't so hard to argue. Really, _specialized_ communities know best. Small forums, small subreddits, the less controversial parts of Wikipedia, Hacker News or Stack Overflow (if you're a nerd like me), or even small blogs with active comment systems.

Here's how the best ones work:

- Specialization (sub-reddits, focused topics, or small scale).
- Voting on content AND comments (or really voting on everything).
- Heirarchies of trust (moderators, invite chains).
- Real people. The more you link an account to a real person, the better. Note: you can keep anonimity _and_ allow multiple accounts per user with this model, but you will require fairly strict verification/signup requirement eventually or lean heavily on specialization.

Google has been running into a problem. They control the main access point to information on the web, and by nature of incentives, that means that everyone wants a piece of the top of their results. How do they combat the ever-growing spectre of spam, and the glut of content produced purely for optimization?

Well, the answer is, as with all things Google: algorithms.

The problem with algorithms is they are fairly easy to game and require constant attention. Is there anything _but_ algorithms? How do you scale anything besides an algorithm?

We aren't proposing to know a grand solution, but we do see some patterns. There's a simple way to get far better search results even on the of Google today. And that is **site filters**.

Let's take some examples. Let's say you start having some joint pain, and get an initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthiritis. If you happen to know a few good sites for supplement information, you can filter down Google's results to just those sites. You'd type the following: "[site:examine.com site:reddit.com supplement rheumatoid arthiritis]()".

There's a whole list of sites like these that I've collected over time, for topics interested to me. Here's a few:

- **Cooking**: [site:seriouseats.com site:chefsteps.com site:modernistcuisine.com [search]]()
- **Economics**: [site:themoneyillusion.com site:marginalrevolution.com site:johnhcochrane.blogspot.com site:econlib.org/econlog/ site:bloomberg.com/opinion site:nathantankus.substack.com site:ft.com [search]]()
- **Personal Finance**: [site:bogleheads.org site:awealthofcommonsense.com site:ofdollarsanddata.com site:news.ycombinator.com site:reddit.com/r/personalfinance [search]]()
- **Coding**: [site:news.ycombinator.com site:stackoverflow.com [search]]()
- **Book Recommendations** [site:reddit.com/r/truelit site:goodreads.com site:5books.com [search]]()
- **Drugs**: [site:blogs.sciencemag.org site:reddit.com/r/nootropics site:reddit.com/r/drugnerds site:examine.com site:gwern.com site:ipscell.com [search]]()

And so on. There are more, but that's for another post. But what I'm drawing attention to here isn't so much the exact sites or filters here, but something else.

### Customizing to taste can be controlled
