## Using the CLI

The Orbit CLI is used to develop and eventually deploy apps with Orbit. The apps can run in a couple
ways:

1. Individually on their own, in their own window.
2. Together in a workspace.

There are also a few props to enforce certain types of selection. You can force on selection with
`alwaysSelected`, and have a default selection with `defaultSelected`. Callback from selections are
`onSelect`.

- Hold your mouse down after clicking an item, to move your selection down.
- Move your mouse to the edge as you select to automatically scroll the list.
