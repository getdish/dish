I'm excited to start talking about Orbit. It's been an intense development period, so it's great to
get it out into the world. We're sending alpha builds to
[mailing list subscribers](https://tryorbit.com) now, please do sign up!

Orbit is a private personal work assistant. It has two basic assumptions:

- You want to easily get answers and quickly find things from across your work information.
- You don't want to give up any privacy in order to do that.

The rest of this post basically goes heavily into our vision and history. If you'd just like to try
Orbit, just sign up or skip to the end to learn how to follow more.

## Why Orbit

You read, write, email, chat, document, ticket... from Slack to Jira, GDocs to Github. Your
knowledge is distributed across many services and a wiki or portal doesn't keep up -- they add
another source of truth, a cumbersome point of interaction, and infrastructure.

There's a trend in the world thats preventing us collaborating effectively. I think it's actually
best explained by the gap between the sci-fi interfaces we dream of in film and TV, and the reality
of how we work today.

The visual effects of Iron Man and Minority Report may be frivolous, but these interfaces do grasp
at a real and unmet desire: for unification, fluidity, and control over our information. Instead,
the web today has become a world of silos. Browsers are silo-explorers, and the cloud is divided by
tabs. To fix this, we'll have break out of the tab. Orbit's mission is to solve this:

## Regaining Control

Orbit is ultimately a play to give us much more control over our data. To do so it's designed as
decentralized platform: think of it as an operating system rather than a service. This distinction
is important. Instead of storing data or adding a source of truth, Orbit just manages existing
information (a lot like browsers and OS's do).

Operating systems gave us a lot of control, via _files_.
[In some forms](https://www.salon.com/2017/09/03/remember-palms-webos-maybe-not-but-apple-and-google-definitely-do/)
they even had beautiful cross-cloud unified contacts, calendars and messages. Browsers gave us the
ability to explore widely, but lost a lot of the control we had in files.

Orbit wants to tilt us back to being able to manage, understand, and organize information. It aims
to let you:

- Find answers and things in your knowledge far more effectively.
- Augment yourself as your normally work.
- Extend/build on that knowledge in flexible ways.
- Do all of this without giving up privacy or security.

### Why Privacy Matters for Some Ideas

Orbit will need to crawl a lot of your sensitive information. But there's unique tension for any
knowledge tool: _no one wants anyone to have 100% of their data_. It's a misaligned incentive we ran
into early and often in user research. We wanted to focus on building a better knowledge tool, but
it was clear having Orbit in the cloud or on-prem would force us to build a good sales team rather
than focus on an already-difficult-enough product.

But today's computers are powerful and is improving nearly weekly to above human-levels in many
cases. We want to be the company that delivers that NLP effectively to your daily life, answering
questions you have across your cloud knowledge.

Today, Orbit runs, syncs, searches -- does everything -- privately on your computer. We still need
to improve it's accuracy, but we have the guarantee in place: we'll never handle your data. You can
even firewall Orbit just to be safe.

### The Features

For now Orbit is a lot like Spotlight, with a Home. The Home shows recent activity, people, and apps
you've installed. Over time Orbit will grow to become more akin to a knowledge assistant. It will
get better at understanding english queries, sorting staleness, augmenting as you work, and
summarizing noisy data. It will also become more contextually aware, which I explain a bit more in
the Context section.

We have some interesting pieces in place. You can intuitively search using natural language by time,
people, date ranges, integrations and more. We build profiles of people from across your cloud, and
we allow you to explore your data intuitively. But we have a long way to go, and we'll update with
interesting information here as we go.

### Get into Orbit

Keep in mind the builds today are early and the interesting pieces are still in development. I think
the next few months will see it grow into something much more usable. I'd love your feedback along
the way to keep us on the right path.
