<IntroText>
  What Dish really is, is a passion project. That is, it's not a go for broke
  scheme to make a ton of money. It isn't a revolutionary new product designed
  to change the world. It was born out my longest burn out - after 5 years of
  building various startups that failed, and three months of doing absolutely
  nothing, I decided one thing: the next thing I do, I want it to be fun. And I
  want to do it my way.

<Paragraph size="xl">
  I had spent the better part of the previous two years building an ambitious
  enterprise play at improving how we build internal apps for teams at tech
  companies, specifically, ones that share data. It's something I felt was
  necessary for the world, but I was realizing month-by-month that I was simply
  in over my head.

## The thesis behind Dish

The Orbit CLI is used to develop and eventually deploy apps with Orbit. The apps can run in a couple
ways:

1. Individually on their own, in their own window.
2. Together in a workspace.

There are also a few props to enforce certain types of selection. You can force on selection with
`alwaysSelected`, and have a default selection with `defaultSelected`. Callback from selections are
`onSelect`.

- Hold your mouse down after clicking an item, to move your selection down.
- Move your mouse to the edge as you select to automatically scroll the list.
