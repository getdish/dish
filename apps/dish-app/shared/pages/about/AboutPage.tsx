              We want to build a fun community of people who curate what they

                  - Instead of having to please everyone to try for 5 stars
                  overall, restaurants should be rewarded for doing one or two

              The ultimate goal is to create a community-powered "Hitchhiker's
              Guide to Gastronomy" (or, a Pok√©dex for poke): a fun, pocket map
              of the world that you can curate, that really shows you uniquely
              good stuff.
