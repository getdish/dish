XCode Problems:

- Previews fail too often and don't recover until you press a key.
  - Even starting a build, switching to a different file, all turns off preview
- Syntax highlighting is very slow and cuts out often
- Doesn't retain knowledge of things with syntax errors, so autocomplete/refactors all break

Swift Problems:

- Adding an struct init() is painful if you have a lot of variables, it goes from being super concise, to very verbose. and dont see any xcode help
- Syntax errors can cause your file to explode with errors from all over way more often than TS
- No SwiftFMT nearly as good as prettier
- Slow compiling
- Slow IDE feedback for most features (autocomplete, type lookups)
- Cannot parse this expression (break down into smaller)

SwiftUI Problems:

- No HMR while running the app, just live preview which isnt nearly as helpful
- While 99% of swift is just a huge upgrade from tsx, closing tags are a easier to navigate, and especially with swiftui's extensions ".onTapGesture", it gets weird
  - could be fixed with some smarter highlighting/xcode comments/permanent close brace highlighting
- Double / CGFloat / Int conversions are a pain
- Seems really easy to cause the compiler to give this:
  - "Expression type '(Int, @escaping () -> Void) -> some View' is ambiguous without more context"
  - and its not clear what causes it
- And this:
  - "Type of expression is ambiguous without more context"
- Getting frustrating compiler based limits:
  - First you get a "cannot parse expression"
  - The you refactor a piece out into a function, then you get:
  - "Generic parameter 'ID' could not be inferred"
  - Then you try and fix and you get "Must break separate statements into new lines"
  - etc, basically unsolvable without a lot of research

- Having to express GeometryReader body diff based on if you single return or not:
  - "return GeometryReader { geometry in"
  - results in:
    - "Cannot convert return expression of type 'GeometryReader<_>' to return type 'some View'"
  - even adding -> ScrollView then the parent body function wants a better type:
    - "Function declares an opaque return type, but has no return statements in its body from which to infer an underlying type"

- Preview doesnt update but not clear why:

"""
  The app "Dish" crashed while updating the preview. Look for crash logs in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports for more details.
