          <p>Letâ€™s talk about food.</p>

          <p>Here's a not-so-secret: Yelp and Google do not capture "good" cuisine for basically any non-american, non-service oriented cuisine.</p>

          <p>Coffee Shop Trading Cards fell flat</p>

          <p>As a millenial, most of the time, I don't give two fucks if a restaurant is dimly lit, the waiters are somewhat rude, and there's no parking.</p>

          <p>I love discovering amazing cuisine and having a "deck" of great spots in the city. And I realized, time and time again, that searching Yelp, or even Google for "the absolute best of X", where X is a dish, was just not great. It didn't _nerd out enough_ about the data. Or if it was decent, like The Infatuated or Eater, it wasn't in a nice and easy to use app that integrated with delivery information.</p>

          <p>This isn't a novel idea. It isn't a moonshot. What it is is a genuine attempt by a couple nerds to make something we really want to exist, something beautiful and enjoyable to use, that doens't feel like it's been designed or put together by a team of managers. It's a passion project, something we can build, think about, and geek out about for years to come.</p>
