              A quick bowl of pho, or slow-smoked ribs? A quaint place for a
              date, or Moroccon Medjool dates? A single star rating doesn't
              capture what you want... but, the comment section does - if you're
              willing to put in the work.

              What you want is a guide. One that understands what makes each
              place special, down to the dish (and ambiance, service, etc). The
              best delivery Pad Thai? Finding it today is a tango with 5
              delivery apps, each with inconsistent ratings.

                Dish aggregates from every food review source as well as every
                delivery app
              </strong>
              . It parses comments to extract specific ratings down to the dish.
              It's a new take on a simple, searchable food guide, built around a
              small community.
