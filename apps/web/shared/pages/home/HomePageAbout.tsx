              you simply care about different things - not just "how many stars"
              a place has. So, dish splits out the factors that matter, as well
              as ratings down to each dish. This has a nice effect - it means
              restaurants won't be forced to please everyone at everything, and
              instead they can focus on doing a few things really well.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph size="xl">
              We're building dish as a food search engine that break things down
              by what matters. We crawl reviews from all over the web (like
              RottenTomatoes, for food), then parse{' '}
              <TextStrong>what people actually say</TextStrong> about all sorts
              of things - dishes, the vibe, service, and more - to build ratings
              on each factor, showing makes each place uniquely good.

                searches every delivery service at once
              </Text>
              , because we found that when ordering delivery, it was especially
              nice to be able to find a specific dish you're craving without
              having to flip between many apps.

              Finally, we are really trying to make a review system and
              community that is more fun, interactive and organic. We think
              granular and reddit-style voting is one factor that helps, and
              another is letting people specialize in certain cuisines and
              locales. We'd like to build a community that helps power the
              algorithms that understand which factors matter, and how to
              describe a given restaurant. We'd love to build:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <TextStrong>A better model for guides üéô</TextStrong> - With
                  natural langauge models, threaded discussions, voting, and
                  specialization, we want to prove that you "map-reduce" an
                  active community into a "current best of" guide.

                  - Instead of having to please everyone to try for 5 stars
                  overall, restaurants should be rewarded for doing one or two
                  things exceptionally well.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Our ultimate goal is to build a sort of community-powered
              Hitchhiker's Guide to Gastronomy (or, a Pok√©dex for poke): a fun,
              pocket map of the world that recognizes uniquely good places all
              over.
