              you care about different things, so Dish splits out ratings into
              every factor that matters - importantly, we go down to the dish.
              So you can find the best pho joint in town.

              We hope it changes the world of eating out and in by letting
              restaurants specialize. Instead of pleasing everyone they can
              focus on doing one or two things really well. Let hole in the wall
              gems thrive!

            <Paragraph size="xl">
              To figure out accurate ratings we crawl every top critic source
              (think RottenTomatoes, for food) and then look at{' '}

              - from the vibe, service, or individual dishes, to whether they
              have a good drinks, are vegetarian friendly, and more. Then, we
              build a map of food uniquely good to each area. Find uniquely good
              places, and exactly what you crave ‚ú®.

              Finally, we're building a curation community that is more fun,
              because you can debate the stats that matter and explore a map of
              gems more intuitively. We think reddit-style voting and
              specialization in cuisines and locales is key. Our goals are to
              build:

                  natural langauge analysis, threaded discussions, voting, and

                  active community into a "current best of" guide.

                  - Instead of having to please everyone to try for 5 stars
                  overall, restaurants should be rewarded for doing one or two

              The ultimate goal is to create a community-powered "Hitchhiker's
              Guide to Gastronomy" (or, a Pok√©dex for poke): a fun, pocket map
              of the world that you can curate, that really shows you uniquely
              good stuff.
