# Dish v1 (second attempt)

Ok, restarting the repo. I did play with a lot, and learned a ton in terms of devops. It's an awfully complex world out there.

In the end it seems either take StaffJoy repo or try Rio. I'm testing Rio now.

Rio should give us basically everything you'd want in a platform: super simple, almost no config, and it gives you *everything* from SSL to git-to-deploy CI/CD, to routing, load balancing, etc. It's a "PaaS" from the guys who have been around forever and seem popular.

I'm running Kubernetes locally using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). It's newer and faster than Minikube and seems to be the best choice.
