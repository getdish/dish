High level plan:

The general strategies that have worked for me in startups are:

1. Make the product shine, especially with better tech and smart design
2. If b2b, get early sales by "selling yourself/service"
3. One person needs to take lead on user-research/talking/selling/refining the
   idea
4. Specialize (one person owns one thing)
5. Setting a team goal for each month - important in the beginning
6. Close-the-loop - get the full thing working early but roughly!
7. Get it into hands - goes with close the loop, but basically have beta users

For Dish specifically, high level:

1. We should heavily use scraping/aggregation
2. Get small subsets working:
   1. Camera/reviews
   2. Rankings for one or two dishes we can validate
3. free form: lets just process as we go!

Initial steps:

1. We should have a sample search we start with and test against
