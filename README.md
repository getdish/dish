## Repo encrypted credentials

To access the secure credentials in this repo, you will need to decrypt them.

- Install [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).
- If you're GPG key hasn't been added to the repo then ask your nearest Dish dev to either be added to the repo or ask for the decryption key.
- If you're GPG key is in the repo and you have `git-crypt` installed, then just use the repo as normal.
- If you're using the raw decryption key it will likely be base64 encoded for ease of communication. If the key ends with a "==" this means you can run `base64 -d [long string of random character==]` to get the raw key.
- Copy the raw key to a file, eg `/tmp/master/key`
- Within the path of the repo run `git-crypt unlock /tmp/master/key`
- You can now just use `git` as normal, all the encryption/decryption happens
  automatically with hooks and filters.
