# Plan

Jan 13 - Start working with Tom ðŸŽ‰

Thoughts:

So we have some real constraints now! Money is down to 200k exactly. I'm
reducing my salary to maintenance mode again (100k/year) which is near where
yours is. At that rate, with all expenses included for the both of us, we have
exactly a year of runway.

But of course, we need to do:

1. time to iterate on launched product
2. user research
3. marketing
4. potential gamification / rewards

# UX

- zoom in/out map as you move the slider so i retains mostly the box

# Backend

- get crawlers to insert into postgres on job complete
- "pho in sf" webapp
- image-crawlers (instagram + deliver service apps)
- delivery-crawlers
