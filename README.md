# Dish

co-founder/job posting:

I've worked on ambitious, technically-challenging, world-changing ideas for the
past 6 years, and I'm sick of it. They are intellectually rewarding but often
spiritually draining as they require massive effort with high chance of failure.

So I've made a resolution - build something fun, and deliverable! Fun to work
on, fun to think about, and especially fun for the user. Something that solves
my own real-world problem and something that absolutely does not involve the
enterprise or groundbreaking technology.

Dish is an app that makes it lightning fast to find "The best X" in your area,
where X is a specific type of food - Pho, Wings, Tacos, you name it. We're
taking what Yelp is horrible at and fixing it (tip: try and find the best asian
food on Yelp, it's impossible). And we're making the interface as fun, fluid,
and modern as possible.

The way I like to think of it is:

Yelp : Facebook :: Dish : SnapChat

Have you read Paul Grahams latest essay[0]? Yelp is a sleepy old giant,
everyones favorite least-favorite app. By changing the review system to focus
just on the dish, we can fix it, and I think the timing is just right.

Dish is perfect for social media + delivery services - it's 10x faster to find
food for delivery, and reviewing a dish is literally just taking a picture,
which you can share to Instagram/Facebook in a tap.

It's the foodie app you always wanted to build yourself. And now you can! Right
now we have the perfect initial two people to bootstrap it (one super
experienced product person from dev to design, one super experienced backend
from devops to search and more), but we'd love to join one more co-founder
developer type.
