# Dish

New plan:

- write crawlers (js)
- setup rio
- setup postgres
- setup nomad in rio for jobs
- get crawlers running on a nomad job
- get nomad admin ui working
- get crawlers to insert into postgres on job complete
- setup hasura
- write basic admin ui web app to see what "pho in sf" returns
- figure out image store (locally run minio just to test?)
- create image-crawlers for better images (instagram + deliver service apps)
- create delivery-crawlers (uber eats, postmates, etc)
- think over ranking / start on search/ranking stuff
