              real world that is entirely driven by users, and avoids the

              It all started with food. In eating around the San Francisco Bay
              Area, we noticed a disturbing trend: too many great
              hole-in-the-wall restaurants were lost to poor ratings. Chinese
              and Vietnamese gems would sit at ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è stars, while places
              with cute interiors but worse food get perfect scores.

              Meanwhile, delivery apps were consistently dissapointing in their

              decent delivered taco or bowl of poke was harder than just walking
              to an alright place nearby.
