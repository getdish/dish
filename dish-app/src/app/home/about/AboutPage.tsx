              We want to build a high quality, fun, collaborative guide to the
              real world that is entirely driven by users, and avoids the

              It all started with food. In eating around the San Francisco Bay
              Area, we noticed a disturbing trend: too many great
              hole-in-the-wall restaurants were lost to poor ratings. Chinese
              and Vietnamese gems would sit at ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è stars, while more
              Americanized with worse food would get nearly 5. One part of the
              problem was at more authentic foreign restaurants people just
              didn't know what their specialty was, how to order it, or what to
              expect.

              Meanwhile, delivery apps have even worse scoring (not fake,
              renamed pop-ups of poor-performing restaurants), finding a decent
              plate you were craving became a chorse. And so Dish was born.
