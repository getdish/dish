              It all started with food. In eating around the San Francisco Bay
              Area, we noticed a disturbing trend: too many great
              hole-in-the-wall restaurants were lost to poor ratings. Amazing

              Instagrammable places with bland food would score near-perfectly.

              Meanwhile, delivery apps have consistently inconsistent ratings,

              whole 5-star issue and finding a decent delivered taco or bowl of

              ratings with a community that tags and rates tags across
              everything, and shares lists of their favorite spots, nights out,
              and dishes. We use your votes, a mini-search engine that crawls
              for outside reviews, and a dash of NLP to show what each place
              excels or dissapoints at more exactly.
