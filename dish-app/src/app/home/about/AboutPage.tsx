              We're building the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, starting with
              earth (and food). Ratings&nbsp;+&nbsp;online communities are
              breaking, we're exploring how to fix them.

            <Paragraph size="xl">
              Food ‚Äî technically, a large bang and a lot of commotion, but
              ultimately ‚Äî tacos and pho in the San Francisco Bay Area. In
              eating around that corner of the galaxy, we'd noticed a disturbing
              trend: international cuisine with poor ratings. Amazing Mexican,
              Chinese and Vietnamese spots with ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è/5 stars due to their
              hole-in-the-wall charms. It was hard to know where to get a good
              bowl of pho.

              Delivery just makes it worse: more inconsistent scores, and new
              "innovations" like virtual pop-ups that are just poorly performing
              restaurants paying for a "rating reset". Getting a decent bowl of
              poke delivered easily is nearly as improbable as an improbability
              drive.
