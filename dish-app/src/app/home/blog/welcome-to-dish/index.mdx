Dish is a better restaurant recommender. We do it differently by understanding natural language. If you want a short, high level overview, check our [About page]().

  I want to introduce a lot of thinking that's gone into Dish in this blog post.
  The first part will be on motivation, and the second will go into some of the
  tech.

### Search has grown out of control

Let's start at the top.

Google has been running into a problem. They control the main access point to information on the web, and by nature of incentives, that means that everyone wants a piece of the top of their results. How do they combat the ever-growing spectre of spam, and the glut of content produced purely for optimization?

Well, the answer is, as with all things Google: algorithms.

The problem with algorithms is they are fairly easy to game. But is there anything _but_ algorithms? How do you scale anything besides an algorithm?

We aren't proposing to know a grand solution, but we do see some patterns. There's a simple way to get far better search results even on the of Google today. And that is **site filters**.

Let's take some examples. Let's say you start having some joint pain, and get an initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthiritis. If you happen to know a few good sites for supplement information, you can filter down Google's results to just those sites. You'd type the following: "[site:examine.com site:reddit.com supplement rheumatoid arthiritis]()".

There's a whole list of sites like these that I've collected over time, for topics interested to me. Here's a few:

- **Cooking**: [site:seriouseats.com site:chefsteps.com site:modernistcuisine.com [search]]()
- **Economics**: [site:themoneyillusion.com site:marginalrevolution.com site:johnhcochrane.blogspot.com site:econlib.org/econlog/ site:bloomberg.com/opinion site:nathantankus.substack.com site:ft.com [search]]()
- **Personal Finance**: [site:bogleheads.org site:awealthofcommonsense.com site:ofdollarsanddata.com site:news.ycombinator.com site:reddit.com/r/personalfinance [search]]()
- **Coding**: [site:news.ycombinator.com site:stackoverflow.com [search]]()
- **Book Recommendations** [site:reddit.com/r/truelit site:goodreads.com site:5books.com [search]]()
- **Drugs**: [site:blogs.sciencemag.org site:reddit.com/r/nootropics site:reddit.com/r/drugnerds site:examine.com site:gwern.com site:ipscell.com [search]]()

And so on. There are more, but that's for another post. But what I'm drawing attention to here isn't so much the exact sites or filters here, but something else.

### What's in common with all these sites?

They are either communities, or blogs.
