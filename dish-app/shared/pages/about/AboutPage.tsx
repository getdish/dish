              So, we're taking a chance and throwing away 5 stars altogether.
              Instead, Dish sorts it's results by points. Points are based on
              all the factors you're searching for, so when you search "quick
              cheap pizza", we take opinions across all reviews as votes for
              quick, cheap, and pizza, and sum them up.

              Then you can upvote and downvote on every factor. In fact, when
