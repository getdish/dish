  When you first hear of Dish, you may think to yourself, "Yelp is fine", or
  "I'm a Google kind of gal", and truly - if you didn't care much for finding
  the *best*, but good enough - or if you have a spare 15 minutes to crawl over
  the comments, you'd be right. You're always right! Look at you.

## Search is broken

Spam is an ever growing concern. So is SEO, and gamifying results. If you have an algorithm - people will do what it takes to make their businesses appear first. PageRank - the engine behind Google - is failing, but there still exists great content - where is it, and how do we curate it?

### One crazy trick to get better search results

The truth is, there's one simple trick to getting 100x better results when searching on the web, and I'll give it to you for free. It's called "site filtering", and with Google, you can simply prefix your query with something like "site:reddit.com". Now, site filtering is a tool. You need to know when to use it. But lately, it's more and more necessary to find _anything good_.
