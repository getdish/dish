- extract hoverStyle/pressStyle
- pass in config to be able to create static extracted easily within web
- support color/text props on vstacks? (rn may not like we'd have to wrap)
- extract media queries
- evaluate constants in other files
- SmallCircleButton case spreads
- Circle, EmojiButton, LinearGradient, VoteButton
- onPressIn/onPressOut etc can all be converted to inline functions still as divs (HomeAutocompleteBackground, SearchLocationButton, etc)
- LinkButton is maybe impossible but good test case for features
