- support color/text props on vstacks? (rn may not like we'd have to wrap)
- spacing
- evaluate constants in other files
  - SmallButton good example case of constant
  - extract hoverStyle/pressStyle (spread + constant too - TagButton, DishView)
    - final step is hoverStyle={{ color: x, ...parent.hoverStyle, }}
  - extract media queries
- pass in config to be able to create static extracted easily within web
- SmallCircleButton case spreads
- Spacer, Divider, Circle, EmojiButton, LinearGradient, VoteButton
- LinkButton - getting this to just extract styles would be big
  - just needs to tell compiler _never_ to go to just <div />
- onPressIn/onPressOut etc can all be converted to inline functions still as divs (HomeAutocompleteBackground, SearchLocationButton, etc)
- LinkButton is maybe impossible but good test case for features
- react-feather: icons: ChevronDown etc
- // TODO WHY SCALE NOT WORKING???
- add a few html props for niceness
  - transition, cursor
- Link - can maybe fully extract, if we can just run the actual component and then return the results???
- could hoist the classname strings out of functions (better done by something like closure, but does closure do it really tho?)
- CSS variables for color!
