- multi level const eval
  - const x = 1, const y = x + 10, paddingTop={y} (current in RestaurantListItem)
- <Image />
- spacing
- evaluate constants in other files
  - SmallButton good example case of constant
- hoverStyle/pressStyle (spread + constant too - TagButton, DishView)
  - final step is hoverStyle={{ color: x, ...parent.hoverStyle, }}
- extract media queries
- pass in config to be able to create static extracted easily within web
- SmallCircleButton case spreads
- Circle, EmojiButton, LinearGradient, VoteButton
- LinkButton - getting this to just extract styles would be big
  - just needs to tell compiler _never_ to go to just <div />
- onPressIn/onPressOut etc can all be converted to inline functions still as divs (HomeAutocompleteBackground, SearchLocationButton, etc)
- LinkButton is maybe impossible but good test case for features
- react-feather: icons: ChevronDown etc
- // TODO WHY SCALE NOT WORKING???
- add a few html props for niceness
  - transition, cursor
- Link - can maybe fully extract, if we can just run the actual component and then return the results???
- CSS variables for color!
