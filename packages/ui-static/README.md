- support color/text props on vstacks? (rn may not like we'd have to wrap)
- evaluate constants in other files
  - extract hoverStyle/pressStyle (spread + constant too - TagButton, DishView)
    - final step is hoverStyle={{ color: x, ...parent.hoverStyle, }}
  - extract media queries
- pass in config to be able to create static extracted easily within web
- SmallCircleButton case spreads
- Spacer, Divider, Circle, EmojiButton, LinearGradient, VoteButton
- onPressIn/onPressOut etc can all be converted to inline functions still as divs (HomeAutocompleteBackground, SearchLocationButton, etc)
- LinkButton is maybe impossible but good test case for features
- icons: ChevronDown etc
- // TODO WHY SCALE NOT WORKING???
