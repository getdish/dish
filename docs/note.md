The nerds guide to everything.

---

There's a problem with the internet. Google says quantity > quality. It seems more often than ever to find anything good you need to "know the spots".

Every proper maven has their curated sources. You search google with filters like "site:reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice " for clothing, or search "site:examine.com " for supplements.

We have more and more information than ever, but it's more fragmented, and hard to trust.

The keys, I think, to fixing the problem are three: Trust, Experts, Community. It's blatantly obvious that all the best sources of information online are at least two of these three

- StackOverflow - Trust + Experts + Community
- Wikipedia - Trust + Experts + Community
- Reddit - Trust (somehwat) + Community
- Examine - Trust + Experts
- Michelin - Trust + Experts

Meanwhile there is a long tail of hard working bloggers, fanatics and nerds who are willing to put in the time and effort if they see the potential for a trustworthy community to curate, organize, and debate "what is good".

Last year I pushed myself harder than I've ever done before, which is saying a lot for someone five years and three pivots into building their own startup, something I'd been in a sense spending my whole life building towards.

I was burnt out. Heavily.

I had downsized the team all the way to just me, and I was determined to go the distance on my world-saving idea for fixing how we glue together information and small internal apps within companies.

Needless to say, one day, after over a year of pushing it on my own, it became so obviously apparent that it would take me at least another two years to do anything well enough to what I'd wanted, that I finally got the message.

I didn't want to work anymore. I didn't know what I wanted to do.

In my burnout I spent a lot of time doing nothing. I ate, watched dumb things, read dumb things. I started improving my life at the margins, margins which had been long ignored and had overgrown.

One day I was reminded of an old startup idea I'd had when first moving to San Francisco: Coffee Shop Trading Cards.

You see, I found Yelp to be horrendous for a use case I'd had, which was that I wanted a map of all the best "workable" cafes in the city.

I needed specific "stats" for my cafes:

- Decent coffee
- Lots of light
- Chargers
- Open late, preferrably
- Comfortable seats

To me, these "factors" were specific just to cafes, and they were crucially important. Finding them all out on Yelp or Google was a huge time waste - I had to search through often hundreds of images to find decent ones showing the whole area, and the reviews often complained of bad service or other fuzzy things I didn't really care about.

But, everyone I knew though who had lived in the city and worked out of cafes had their own "deck" of their favorite coffee shops - even including hole in the walls and secretly accessible lounges in hotels and so on.

I felt that it could scale too: I had recently begun dating a native of Vietnam, exploring the bay area and discovering all sorts of amaing new Vietnamese dishes I'd never even heard of.

My girlfriend had her own very specific factors for finding great Vietnamese. Take Pho for example, you have certain things that are great indicators of quality:

- Do they use Thai Chilis
- Do they not look fancy inside or have an american name
- Do they serve other authentic dishes
- Do they specialize in Northern, Central or Southern cuisine

Ultimately, I didnt decide on building the app. It felt like something the world needed, but I had a job already, and when I revisited the idea during my burnout it didn't capture me as uniquely relevant.

That was, until, one night when I was ordering some delivery, and we were craving some good Pho.

The experience was... something else.

First of all, there are 5 popular delivery apps in San Francisco. Each one of them take time to load and search.

Second, once you find your pho, you have to filter on a variety of factors like delivery cost.

But most importantly, vetting the restaurants just a huge pain in the ass.

Here's a not-so-secret secret: Yelp and Google absolutely do not capture "good" asian food almost at all. They capture "ok" asian food with "great" service/ambiance, but they negatively filter out "great" asian food with "bad" service/ambiance. But with delivery - I don't care about service, or ambiance, or even if they make everything else on the menu horribly except for just the one type of Pho we were craving.

I launched into a rant, which essentially went, "why cant i just find the best of a single dish? like why do i have to manually sort through so many reviews to filter out service and all these other factors?".

And with the advent of Instagram and Facebook Stories, in a world where delivery food is growing more and more, I found something that looked like a startup.

Where Coffee Shop Trading Cards fell flat - it was too complex, in explaining to people, and in how it solved problems - the idea of "Dish", or "dish-only reviews" went the other way - it simplified a convoluted system, ie, one star rating for everything from service to every plate they served, into the most fundamental unit - did I like the specific plate I ate.

It was the stripping down that resonated. Start by doing less - a lot less, but in a way that fixes a big pain points. I liked it.

It wasn't just that delivery services had poor ratings (they do), or that Yelp/Google totally miss out on ranking asian food based on the food quality (they do), but it was this:

As a millenial, most of the time, I don't give two fucks if a restaurant is dimly lit, the waiters are somewhat rude, and there's no parking. Most of the time. I love discovering amazing cuisine and having a "deck" of great spots in the city. And I realized, time and time again, that searching Yelp, or even Google for "the absolute best of X", where X is a dish, was just not great. It didn't _nerd out enough_ about the data. Or if it was decent, like The Infatuated or Eater, it wasn't in a nice and easy to use app that integrated with delivery information.

Yelp and Google review _restaurants_.

What I realized was, I didn't necessarily need to do the trading cards idea - instead of rating things on _many_ factors, we could just fix most of my problems by instead rating them on _even less_ factors.

An aside -

Listen, I know what you're thinking. This isn't a novel idea. It isn't a moonshot.

What it is is a genuine attempt by a couple nerds at finally aligning my passions behind my work, and something that is just plain fun to build, think about, and geek out about for years to come.

Ultimately, the long-run appeal of Dish to me became apparent right after that insight.

It was this - I am ultimately, and always have been, a information nerd. I love finding great things. I love researching and exploring an area to really find out what matters, and what to recommend.

Realizing that there was such a big gap in what I wanted - to find what I'm craving to eat, fast, and order it on delivery or just quickly find the location - was something I came to reluctantly.
