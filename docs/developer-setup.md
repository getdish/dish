## Getting Started

### Repo encrypted credentials

All Dish's credentials are stored in `.env`. Even third-party web logins are contained in this file. To decrypt it:

- Install [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).
- If you're GPG key hasn't been added to the repo then ask your nearest Dish dev to either be added to the repo or ask for the decryption key.
- If you're GPG key is in the repo and you have `git-crypt` installed, then just run
  `git-crypt unlock` and use the repo as normal.
- However, if you're GPG isn't in the repo, you'll need to use a raw decryption key, which will likely be base64 encoded for ease of communication. If the key ends with a "==" this means you can run `base64 -d [long string of random character==]` to get the raw key.
- Copy the raw key to a file, eg `/tmp/master/key`
- Within the path of the repo run `git-crypt unlock /tmp/master/key`
- You can now just use `git` as normal, all the encryption/decryption happens
  automatically with hooks and filters.

### Using environment in commands

You can avoid copy-pasting environment variables using this:

```
./dsh run 'some_command_that_needs_dish_ENV'
```

To switch env set DISH_ENV.

## Core Stack

The core stack contains the minimum services needed to run the web app locally. This stack
can be easily run with Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

When working with Dish's Docker images you'll often need to be logged into our Docker

Registry: `./dsh docker_login`.

Some helper commands to get started:

- `yarn bootstrap`: builds the base image
- `yarn start` will run docker-compose for local development

Once you're logged in and have Docker Compose installed, go to the root of this repo and run:

`docker-compose up`

For initial installation you may need to run this command a few times so postgres can generate encryption keys. You will also need to use an `init` arg to the first migrations run:

`./dsh hasura_migrate`

When you need to rebuild the containers to update their code run:

`docker-compose build`

To build an individual container:

`docker-compose build [container-name]`

So, for example `docker-compose build dish-app`.

## Debugging broken docker build

You see the steps in the build?

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  7.168kB
Step 1/6 : FROM node:10.15.1-alpine
 ---> fe6ff768f798
Step 2/6 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> d9b21154b260
Step 3/6 : COPY package.json yarn.lock /app/
 ---> Using cache
 ---> f72815b0addf
Step 4/6 : RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 9ac88c8d0b9d
```

Just do this for any step to get shell access:

```
docker commit 9ac88c8d0b9d tempname
docker run -ti --rm tempname sh
```

## The Web App

At the root of the monorepo:

### Install dependencies

- `yarn install`

### Build (and auto rebuild on file changes)

`yarn build:watch`

### Run

- `yarn web` (for development)
- `yarn web:prod` (for production)

### Endpoints

You'll want to add:

```
d1sh.com 127.0.0.1
d1staging.com 127.0.0.1
d1live.com 127.0.0.1
```

Which are for local, staging, prod, respectively.

### Run end to end tests

First build the docker container, this can take up to 30 minutes:

    * At the very root of the entire git repo:
      `docker build -t dish/app -f dish-app/Dockerfile .`

    * Run the production build of the web site (it exposes on port 4444):
      `docker run -it --rm --net host dish/app`

    * To connect to our production backing services:
      * add 127.0.0.1 d1live.com to /etc/hosts
      * visit http://d1live.com:4444

If you want to run end to end tests:

    * Make sure the [core stack](#core-stack) is up:
      `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

    * Run the migrations:
      ```
      ./dsh db_migrate_local
      ./dsh timescale_migrate_local
      ```

    * To connect to these local services, visit:
      'http://localhost:80'

    * Run the tests. from the `dish-app` path:
      `yarn test` (specs, etc)
      `./test/testcafe.sh` (integration tests)

## Hot Deploys

If you need to deploy something quickly and are willing to skip CI, you can run a hot deploy.

You'll need a few things set up first:

    - On production: `kubectl` and `doctl` installed
    - `doctl auth init -t $DO_DISH_KEY` token is avaiable in enc.env.yaml
    - `doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save dish[blue/green]`
    - On production and staging, you'll need `flyctl` in order to login to our Docker registry.

Then you can use the `./dsh hot_deploy path/to/Dockerfile/folder`

## Hasura

### Hasura CLI

The Hasura CLI is useful for a variety of admin tasks such as creating/running
migrations and serving an admin web UI. We have both local and live instances of the Hasura console, NB: never change schema or metadata on the live Hasura console, these changes will not get persisted between deploys and can potentially cause out of sync issues. Instead, always make DB changes on your local Hasura console, this will create new files in the `services/hasura/migrations` path of the repo. You should commit them and so that they'll be automatically deployed by CI.

#### Installing the Hasura CLI:

```
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/master/cli/get.sh | bash
```

If this is your first install, or there's new migrations waiting to be run:

`hasura migrate apply --endpoint http://localhost:8080 --admin-secret=password`

To remove data / reset dev env:

`docker-compose rm -f`

Then run the admin UI using:

`hasura console --endpoint http://localhost:8080 --admin-secret=password`

This will set up two way persistence so when you modify tables it persists to
your migrations.

After a while the migrations folder can get very full. Apart from being noisy, this also adds time to CI builds. It can be good to sometimes consolidate all the migrations into a single one. I've had success with this method: https://hasura.io/blog/resetting-hasura-migrations/

### Seed/Live data

This is a big dump, can potentially take nearly an hour to import:
`./dsh restore_latest_main_backup_to_local`

### Misc

#### Using the live DB from your local machine

Note that the `@dish/graph` package is set up to use the live Hasura instance if the
domain name contains 'live'. You can set such a domain up on your local machine using the `/etc/hosts` file with an entry like `127.0.0.1 d1sh_hasura_live.com`. You may want to avoid spelling 'dish' with a real 'i' as that might be a keyword for triggering other production features.

## Kubernetes

Our Kubernetes (k8s) is managed by Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code framework. This means that all changes to the cluster architecture and state can be tracked in Git. Some changes such as autoscaling changes are obviously not tracked.

### Getting started

#### Prerequisites

All of these should be installable through your OS's standard package manager (Brew, Snaps, PPAs). However, most of these also have oneliner `curl` commands to install simple static binaries.

- [`doctl`](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl): Talking to the Digital Ocean API.
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): Talking to the Kubernetes API.
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html): Infrastructure As Code. Talking to the k8s API.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/): Kubernetes package manager.

#### Authorizing `doctl`

`doctl auth init -t $DIGITAL_OCEAN_API_TOKEN`
(Token is avaiable in `enc.env.yaml`)

#### Creating the cluster for the first time

- `./etc/terraform_init.sh` Connects to DO Spaces to save state. Downloads modules
- `terraform apply -target=module.cluster` Just build the bare compute resources
- `doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save dish[blue/green]` Sets up `kubectl`
- `terraform apply` Adds all the remaining resources

#### Connecting to an existing cluster

- `terraform init` Connects to DO Spaces to save state. Downloads modules
- `doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save dish[blue/green]` Sets up `kubectl`

##### Load Balancer IP

A platform-specific load balancer will be created outside the Kubernetes cluster. On DO it doesn't currently seem possible to associate a specific IP address. So you will need to look at the DO UI under Networking->Load Balancers to find the new IP address and assign it as an A record to the appropriate domain.

#### Deploying

##### Notes on creating a new Kubernetes cluster

When setting up a Blue/Green cluster, I found that:

- `nodeSelector` isn't powerful enough to prevent the CI node getting full of other pods. But
  DO still haven't developed native support for taints/tolerations. Watch:
  https://github.com/digitalocean/DOKS/issues/3
- `./dsh hot_deploy path/to/Dockerfile` for each service needed to be run. This could be done by doing a Github deploy too.
- In Hasura's console, I needed to click the "Reload metadata" button to get Hasura consistent
  with the DB again. I have no idea why.

### What's on our cluster?

Most importantly the main services like the web app, worker, user server, ML endpoints etc.

Of particular note:

#### Databases

The main DB is Postgres (under the `postgres-ha` namespace), it is setup in High Availability
mode with replication and failover. There is also another Postgres DB (Timescale) that just keeps our scrape data. And Redis is installed to keep worker jobs.

#### Nginx Ingress

This is basically our interface to the public internet. It's hooked up
to Lets Encrypt via a Helm-installed cert-manager service to automatically manage SSL certs.
We have wildcard certs `*.k8s.dishapp.com`. If you want lower level subdomains (eg; `super.dishapp.com`), you wil need to add rules in the relevant `kubernetes_ingress` Terraform resource. Nginx Ingress can also do everything that Nginx can do.

#### Prometheus

Prometheus is a monitoring framework. It collects metrics from all kinds of places, both from
the cluster itself and the various apps and services running on the cluster. The main access
to Prometheus is via its Grafana UI: https://grafana.k8s.dishapp.com The username is `admin`
and the password is in `.env`

#### Sentry error tracking and management

Sentry is an advanced error tracking interface: https://sentry.io/welcome/

Our service is at https://sentry.k8s.dishapp.com The username is 'admin@sentry.local'
and the password is in `.env`.

#### Kubernetes dashboard

The k8s dashboard gives a good overview of everything running on the cluster. It can be
very helpful for debugging. Though do remember `kubectl` can do everything the dashboard
does and more. The dashboard is provided by Digital Ocean:
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/kubernetes/clusters/f2db42e5-2407-4422-920d-b307bc5f636d/dashboard/ Though they don't seem to update the underlying dashboard version very often, so
we could deploy our own at somepoint with a Helm chart.

## Staging

Our staging VM is completely independent of our Kubernetes cluster. The staging VM runs on a single Digital Ocean droplet. It simply runs the same `docker-compose` setup used by local devs. The SSH private key is stored encrypted in our repo so you should be able to SSH in with:

`./dsh staging_ssh`

Deployment should happen automatically for all succesful builds on the staging branch. However, if you want changes to `docker-compose.yaml` to take affect you'll need to SSH in and manually deal with it.
