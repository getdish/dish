- list making is/will be a better review form
- design list entry as review as flexible document-db interface
- list commenting



- auto-lists based on your votes
- make map work with custom point data structure instead of restaurantId (represent restaurant, OSM, other types of points)
- import osm and integrate into playlists search
- after autocomplete select tag, needs to clear input value of tag
- [m] [0] (restaurantpage) tap: address, phone, website get working
- make lists prettier (formatting esp with writing)
- fix mobile web bugs
- beta / invite features
- "bring map life" project (home, then others)
- mobile
- should we do a mobile web mode that is just flat / no drawer,
    - may actually save time in not too long run?

ideas around "what would make for really interesting data-focused articles?" eg analyzing cuisine trends over time, showing a lot of points across larger areas, and more.

similary, split out other types of articles and see what overlaps
