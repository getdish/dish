  - playlists for play
  - pokedex strikes the right balance: polished, personal, fun
  - trading cards - stats on each thing broken down, data driven, create "stacks" of favorite coffee shops
  - hitchhikers guide to the galaxy - whats unique, a place to store real opinion
  - ultimately the concerns wouldnt just be commercial like yelp or google, but also exploration, activity, outdoors, culture, history - wikipedia for a map
  - but the community aspect should drive it - "map reduce" from discussions into a "current best of page"
  - no great way to plan trips, to explore cities by what makes them great, long term goal is this
  - want to be on user side and not data mine, because we want people to trust they can really invest in curating their own adventure book.
    - able to post things privately, and have a "friends" scope
    - we are exploring paid-for models for upgraded features to avoid advertising pressures
    - want to invest in communities and have local champions, invest in local popups
  - by breaking down things by the factors that matter, not just a single 5 star ratings, we want to foster the japanese style in a sense - do "one thing well" - or the portland style of embracing quirkyness - let restaurants and shops avoid tyranny of the majority and specialize without negative effects

after alpha:

- revisit ssr
- show a list of hot & new restaurants on homepage, simple and easy win, with link to breakdown to comment easily...
- mobile web needs some sort of slight redesign

---

big impact changes

- social - having chef profiles
- showing the icons for top/vibe/bar/green on list items with one click vote
- threading on comments is the only way you get discussion which leads to clarfiication, which is both what keeps people around and what allows us to get much richer info
- make map more alive
  - colors by category (cuisine?)
  - hovering a group can make those bubbles get preference and enlarge
  - hover restaurant show it on map (but without moving it, maybe marker zoom)
  - liking a restuarant could drop a heart
  - emoji icons once you get to a zoom level
  - speeding it up in general
- adding in hot & new / popups / instagram
  - basically, social features
- home needs to feel more like a discussion
  - so do all other pages
  - basically do a sprint on bringing out discussions
    - for EACH SOURCE pick and show 2 positive, 2 middle, 2 negative
- some sort of way to see categories of things on the map quickly
  - home page hovering a section could show all the restaurants within that section
    - is there some generic way we can then make this a feature "highlighted group of restaurants for map"?s
- Admin icons multiselect
- "explore mode" or "auto re-search" basically just have map research as you move

---

## bigger impact changes

- importing instagram and other feed data to have more aliveness
- top dishes <=> map pins + easily moving around cities.
  - then easily filter it down to any cuisine (top right input opposite "Uniquely Good")

# Ratings

- Get experts on board
- have them easily rate/comment, etc
- Use them as profiles
