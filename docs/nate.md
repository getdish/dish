  - hovering a group can make those bubbles get preference and enlarge
  - hover restaurant show it on map (but without moving it, maybe marker zoom)

  - emoji icons once you get to a zoom level
  - speeding it up in general
- adding in hot & new / popups / instagram
  - basically, social features
- home needs to feel more like a discussion
  - so do all other pages

    - for EACH SOURCE pick and show 2 positive, 2 middle, 2 negative
- some sort of way to see categories of things on the map quickly
  - home page hovering a section could show all the restaurants within that section
    - is there some generic way we can then make this a feature "highlighted group of restaurants for map"?s

## GPT-3

- build a summarizer:
  - for 10 restaurants of diverse cuisine:
    - collect 10 diverse reviews:
      - put them all concatted together above
      - then put """, then write a fun, funny, short summary calling out a few unique things from the reviews
  - then collect 5 more restaurants of different cuisines, 10 reviews each:
    - see if it summarizes them nicely
  - plug into actual app for top X restaurants
    - maybe do it based on homepage results so they are likely to see

- Dish Sentiment + summary for search results
- Each lense could get a summary too - Vibe / Drinks / Vegetarian
- Tips
  - when to go to beat the rush?
  - can you sit at the bar?
  - where to park?
  - pull out anything that mentions "tip"
