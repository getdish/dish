## community

communities can redefine segments. peloton is a good example.

dish has long thought about communities - almost like subreddits,
you could set up a community within your area that shares what 
they eat, and what they like.

but it may be interesting to try and push the community ideas.

things i think dont seem great: planning nights out together,
"dating" or other meetup planning.

things that may work: planning a trip with friends (once we have
more than just restaurants).

things i like:

- following "influencers" on dish - chefs you like,
etc. positioning dish more as a "twitter for chefs" seems cool,
especially since instagram has sort of lost its appeal as a place
you post your food stuff.

- "trip sharing" basically its not that cool to share just one
night, but if you share your whole trip on a map thats cool
