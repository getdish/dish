Two things bring us to launch (once any app works):

- Ratings improvements
- Search across all delivery services

# Ratings Improvements

- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whose-reviews-should-you-trust-imdb-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-or-fandango-7d1010c6cf19/

One thing to note first, there are technically two types of ratings (restaurant, dish).

Assume our baseline reviews are just a bit better than Yelp/Google at 60%, ways I see we can improve:

- Experts: get a cabal of experts to join and submit ratings

  - (prior) +accuracy ~20%
  - can we then use them to filter out "poor taste" from other review datasets?
    - (prior) +accuracy 5-20%
    - depending on how you do it could be very useful or not much

- Prune-non-food: remove reviews that mention bad service, ambiance, waiters, etc etc

  - (prior) +accuracy ~15%

- Dish-level: extract dish-specific mentions for positive or negative sentiment from existing reviews
  - (prior) +accuracy ~10% for restaurants, but a lot for dishes

## Thoughts behind

My prior for starting dish is basically that "ratings accuracy" for actual food for Yelp/Google is at about 60%. I think infatuated may be closer to 70%, michelin close to 95% (but for only a couple thousand), the delivery services 30%.

We want to bring that up to 90%+.

In other industries you see ratings aggregators that consistently are very accurate. The best example is Rottentomatoes, so much so that theres a massive quora thread debating if its declines in recent years (https://www.quora.com/Has-Rotten-Tomatoes-become-less-reliable-overinflated-in-recent-years-2015%E2%80%9317-Has-Rotten-Tomatoes-become-too-agenda-driven-to-be-reliable).

Why I like rottentomatoes

- mostly, they consistently match my expectations, and most importantly, their 90%+ movies are maybe 95% accurate (granted, i assist them a lot by not seeing any movie that i know doesnt appeal to my current mood, but in dish's case users would do the same thing - theyd know if theyre craving sushi already, whereas mood for movies is more complex)
- 0-100 scale is more memorable and precise, I've thought on this for a while and I like it for restaurants i think (you'd also show #1, #2, #3...)
  - to me, its nice to see 92 vs 95 vs 98, i actually sense big differences in that range. in the lower tiers i don't mind...
  - only downside would be does it confuse the ratings too much or feel to foreign to people?
- anything above a 85% or so is "gold", similar to the idea of having a "star" or no star show / crown etc
  - nice for handing out for promo - we're a "\*" restaurant!

Rottentomatoes is even interesting because they split out experts from the audience.

Idea for really sexy things that will catch attention (later):

- Camera shows current guessed restaurant name at top and lets you drag it on as a sticker
