ideas around "what would make for really interesting data-focused articles?" eg analyzing cuisine trends over time, showing a lot of points across larger areas, and more.

- Home page now shows me all my favorite stuff nearby thats open_now by default
- Home page shows quick links to search my favorite dishes/cuisines
