## Upvote/Downvote restaurant

Upvoting/downvoting a restaurant in pages like "/mission" doesn't work and the backend feature doesn't seem to be implemented as talked with @tom, when trying to get the tag in order to be able to review the restaurant with the corresponding vote it, giving it the globalTagId it returns nothing, and as @tom mentioned me, there isn't any way to make a review on a restaurant without a tag, and the score not only is constructed with votes.
