GOAL

Lets have fun with it! ðŸ˜Œ

Our overarching goal is: fun, fast, accurate.

"LAST MONTH OF TRUE SHLEPPING"

Ok so really, need to do a variety of less fun things until we really get to the fun parts, but, we're so close to the fun parts its fun just getting the less fun parts done quick!

We missed our peach goal because we made the web app instead of just an admin panel. That was "out of order" but i think the right decision - instead of building a whole separate interface, we just built the website and almost did it within our deadline - with a lot of polish.

I've also updated my beliefs after some thought.

We definitely want to get people on board ASAP and especially get feedback, but there's some value to us really iterating a bit on a "sorta-working" version of the app ourselves, and just trying to figure out _WHAT_ it is we can do thats interest, cool, faster for them.

I think they would input a ton more and even just start using it more seriously, and if they felt good about it, they would give us a ton more info.

The social side of the app is interesting.

Chef picks and chef comments could be done really well.

Chef lists could be very interesting and not far from working.

A few small touches in the interface to make tag/tagrating really smooth

Some touches for letting people "move around the world" quickly and see various places.

Etc.

I am going to chat with peach more as we go too and still aim to get him on board early, next week sometime.

The biggest things to make the app come alive though will be to get the data more in place and curated.

So, for Tom:

- Data sources!
  - We really need delivery services + one more good source of ratings, and in general to improve various information and correlation of restaurants
- Disaggregation of sub-ratings!
  - (pulling out "service" etc raings from crawler reviwers)
  - We really need to be able to start pulling out dish/service/ambiance focused sub-parts and splitting out those ratings from the data we crawl, this is our "bread and butter".
- Lense filling

I do think having you totally focused on what you're good at for longer is what we should do, and me the same. The trade-off is we may deliver a bigger, badder thing a bit later on rather than a more taped-together thing earlier.

# triage

## blog

- need to write a good intro or two blog posts for launch
- simple static blog generator or similar
- we should start idea gathering soon for posts
- start sketching out posts

## marketing

- cheap billboards in smaller markets?
- maybe one expnsive one going from the airport into the city for tourists
  - capture: "Your insider app for the best stuff to see/do in SF"
  - airport ad?
- travellers may really want this (cheaper markets?)
