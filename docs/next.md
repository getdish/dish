# april, may, june

- we missed like all goals :(, but we have some great ideas on how to actually make dish a real company
  - downstream delivery / shopify whitelabel delivery
  - content - focus on business of delivery, business of restaurants, master guide, how to manage, supplies, insurance etc
  - we really improved the stack more and also how we display data more than you'd expect, hopefully that speeds us up going forward

# june

- we gotta get the community site out end of month - no more excuses!!!

# triage

## blog

- need to write a good intro or two blog posts for launch
- simple static blog generator or similar
- we should start idea gathering soon for posts
- start sketching out posts

## marketing

- cheap billboards in smaller markets?
- maybe one expnsive one going from the airport into the city for tourists
  - capture: "Your insider app for the best stuff to see/do in SF"
  - airport ad?
- travellers may really want this (cheaper markets?)

---

- seeing dish details (learn names of dishes, ingredients, pairing, etc), making you smarter just by using it
