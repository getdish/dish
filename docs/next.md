# triage

## community

- single screen list, dense, spreadsheet-like, emoji lense voting
- auth/login
- mapkit and map integration (later)
- comments?

## blog

- need to write a good intro or two blog posts for launch
- simple static blog generator or similar
- we should start idea gathering soon for posts
- start sketching out posts

## marketing

- cheap billboards in smaller markets?
- maybe one expnsive one going from the airport into the city for tourists
  - capture: "Your insider app for the best stuff to see/do in SF"
  - airport ad?
- travellers may really want this (cheaper markets?)
