✔️ implement v1 point ratings + voting
- changes to auth:
  - login with email or username
  - register with email + username
- profiles loading really slow http://d1sh_hasura_live.com:19006/u/admin
- fix top level lense results
  ✔️  "gems" with no other filters is empty for sf
✔️  fix http://d1sh_hasura_live.com:19006/restaurant/serafina error on gql review when not logged in
- searching without tag is slow - try "birria taco" in sf
  - this is because of the full-text search across reviews and menu_items tables. there's a
    a bit of research i could to improve the index. but maybe we need to look at a dedicated
    full-text engine. but remember that searching for tags is still as fast as ever
- ... continue on ratings/points/sentiment/data/infra

✔️ search speed, add pre-computation for restaurant_tag.mention_count
✔️ review_agg perms for anon users
- results page hasura query performance investigation
✔️ vote table, we still need to think about the UI, what happens when someone votes up on main and down on all contributing tags?
- rtag.sentences relation for easy access to all mentions of a rish in reviews
- self crawler has production-only bug where null tags are appearing in tag score SQL (and failing the crawl for that restaurant)

# Triage

## Low Priority

- [] Crawlers - Closed restaurants. Lucca's Ravlioli closed a year ago, maybe we just need to scrape that info from yelp et al (http://d1sh_hasura_live.com:19006/restaurant/lucca-ravioli-co-california/:dish?)
