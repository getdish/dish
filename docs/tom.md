Previously

- filters API
  - types: lense, cuisine, simple
    - lense: uses emojis, can be voted on or controlled by us
    - simple: combines with lense: price, open now, delivers, etc
  - { query GetFilters(type: "lense") { name, icon, type, id } }
    - icon is a String / emoji
  - cuisine ("country")
    - one type of filter we'll have is cuisines, on the home screen:
      - grouped by continent! right now i'm doing something like:
        - "North American": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ American", "ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Mexican"
        - so perhaps we want something like groupID on filters, and then i can just hardcode which ids map to which continents for simplicity like so:
          - 1001 = Americas
          - 1002 = Africa
          - ...
    - i'll fetch all the filters on startup essentially
- search
  - can pass it filters
  - { query SearchRequest(filters: [{ id: "0", value: true }], geoLocation: {} { restaurants } }
- home
  - shows the top dishes based on your current filters
  - heres an example filter:
    - [Delivers: true, Cuisine: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, Lense: "Chef Picks"]
  - all we fetch from this is top dishes like so:
    - { query GetTopDishesFor(filters: [], geoLocation: {}) { name, id, image } }
- restaurant info
  - geolocation, address, phone
  - dishes
  - rating
- ratings
  - star or no star
  - should be returned in all areas for both dish + restaurant
  - restaurant is just generated as an aggregate of dish + yelp and other crawled info we use
  - mutation for rating dish
- lenses
  - this is for the community / admin
  - { mutation VoteRestaurantLense(userId: "", filterId: "", value: true) }

# admin

- spreadsheet view into data
  - dishes/restaurants
  - search
  - voting
- taxonomy view for managing categorization
- city view for seeing the top unique best places per-city for the explore page
