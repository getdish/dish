# Dish 6 month rough plan

Ok, so lets really align!

TL;DR

1. Build a nice iOS app for exploring good cuisine by dish in SF-first
2. Build a content/web site and content market Listicles/data-driven-articles
3. Set up a marketing campaign #cancelyelp, make it funny

## High level

First things, we should really understand how long of a shot this is. It's overwhelmingly likely we fail, and the absolute most likely reason is:

1. We don't deliver a lean app, early, and iterate many times
2. We don't do content marketing nearly enough or early enough

In other words, more than anything we need to:

1. Get the app working on iOS ASAP and released to app store
2. In parallel, have a strategy + implement content marketing

Everything else here is mostly mapping out the above two things.

A note on business:

We need to raise money.

To do that, we need to build a tiny but sexy rocket, then launch it successfully and show we are competent tiny-sexy-rocket-builders-and-launchers.

We *don't* need to:

1. Launch across many platforms
2. Launch in many cities or places
3. Have the newest technology (but do want some)
4. Have clean code
5. Solve hard technical problems first

It's a position I haven't been in in a while, it's a lot different than the strategy (post raise or bootstrapped) somewhat, but not entirely.

Why do we need to raise? Because we're aiming at Yelp and really at a lot of companies (Eater, Michelin, Google/AppleMaps), and there's simply no way we get anwhere close to that on $200k.

So, we gotta raise.

My goal is always to preserve as much equity as possible for the us, and I always advocate for doing things leaner than I think many in the valley would, so we'll do that.

Zooming out

Since I'm writing a big ol' document, here's section on perspective.

I don't want much. Don't want to run a big company, work ourselves to the bone, achieve fame, etc.

I want is to be able to tackle things at the intersection of interesting work and real world problems - with freedom, creativity, in a nice environment.

Lets aim to enjoy this venture.

We can still be about as ruthless, frugal, passionate, efficient, etc as many. But happiness and enjoyment are key parts of ensuring your machine is efficient.

Lets:

- Keeping the team small, focused, distraction-free
- Surprise each other by quietly getting things done, well
- Finding great collaborators who bring fresh ideas
- Let people work in a way makes them comfy so long as we can be effective

One note on how we can position ourselves in the market that is fun

Ok so, first, understanding some of my influences are good. I'd say you can get a good model of my business sense through a few sources:

1. Thiel's "Zero to One" is probably the best high level book.
2. Stratechery's writings are super valuable, especially "Aggregation Theory" [0]
3. I don't agree with all of it, but a lot of pg's writings and YC's startup school is good practical/strategical advice. Choice ones would be "How to raise money" [1], "Do things that don't scale" [2], "Ramen profitable" [3], "Fashionable problems" (especially relevant) [4]

### Aggregation Theory

Aggregation theory especially is important for Dish. You can probably get most of it just from this article [5].

We can be the Netflix/Zillow of food, rather than Yelp which, being a first-party source of content especially since they own their own delivery service (Eat24/GrubHub), means they *wont* ever be an aggregator.

This opens up a potential opportunity because it means we can aggregate *both* delivery services and food ratings, and doing so seems additive:

> as a user I want rating aggregation, I want delivery aggregation, and it would be especially useful in the same place!

It avoids the problem of "what do i want to eat" requiring a lot of decision making especially when ordering delivery, where you may have a few apps you could choose from.

I'm not positive aggregation is 100% necessary, but it's a nice lense to look through.

10x better & The Map

I don't want to get too too deep here, but this part is interesting.

I think exploration is really underserved. Look at Yelp: you search "food" and it just throws a few pins at your in your area.

We can definitely do 10x better here - and doing things 10x better is a really good rule of thumb for "should we do this as a startup".

I think we can do two, maybe three things 10x better:

1. Asian (and non-service-focused) restaurant ratings
2. Just exploring of "what's good/popular in this area"
3. Searching across all delivery services (doesn't exist...)

I'm currently on the tail end of the first vacation I've taken in too long in Hawaii and number 2 has really become apparent. The apps we use today feel like they don't optimize at all for the real use case they have:

"I want to find great food, and I may not know exactly what is great around me, or even what I'm craving exactly, but I do know I want to find it and I do have a variety of constraints"

---

Eventually going broad

So we'll be laser focused on dishes. But just a note on how we *could* expand.

I'll phrase this similar to the infamous Elon/Tesla memo. Here's the plan:

1. Build a great local-dish finding app in a limited market
2. Make it work better around the world
3. Expand without "genercizing/featurizing" to being the best way to "understand/explore good stuff in a local area"

Re: point 3

But being an aggregator means you *should* feel perfectly suited for what you're aggregating. We are aggregating food. We should go very deep there! Ratings, tag breakdowns, the way we pick images, etc etc. Lets make it all suited to it's function.

I do think that later though we could fill another gap I see generally which is that no map app does a great job of being a "become an expert in this area" really well at all. The exploration part is really poor.

I'd love to tap a üçΩ icon at the top, change it to ‚òïÔ∏è, and see all coffee shops. But, really be able to see the top 10 clearly and browse the cool stuff in my neighborhood (sorted out from the "ok"), have the filters super customized to them (open late, has chargers, comfy seating, good lighting), and have the reviews capture those aspects more clearly.

I think this state of mind should lead us to a much better place than Google Maps or Yelp.

Finally:

In the very very long term, this nicely leads us to becoming the best local search / trip planning app essentially.

You could just go to your trip location (Hawaii), browse super easily, and we can make it easy to throw a bunch of favorites into a bucket. Then take that bucks and have a little "auto trip planner" mode that helps you put together a multi-day trip with various spots in line!

Whew!

So back to the concrete game plan (aka, We Need to Raise)

Here's the other factors we need:

1. Growth
2. A pitch thats been battle tested
3. Some combination of nicely done brand/product/marketing

One way to think of it is: if we are just developing for most of the month, we are failing. We need to be focuse on growth at every step.

And for VC's - we need to be somewhat sexy. Honestly, sex appeal is just under-valued because it really multiplies with your growth numbers. But it's *only* useful if combined with growth.

I like to think of it in analogy to Tesla:

First: Build a Roadster

Small, easier to build, uses many parts from other things, high end, expensive, sexy, and meant to impress. Extremely good branding and design to prove to the world you're "worth it".

Then, Build a Model S / X

This isn't as relevant to us until we build a Roadster, but notice their second step wasn't to go down market. It was to go broad on the high end. We should do the same.

Then, Build a Model 3 for everyone

You could make the case that each of these is actually for a "round", Roadster for Seed, S/X for A (maybe B too), etc.

## Lower level plan

I had a longer piece here describing the thinking behind the thinking, but for the sake of simplicity here is the plan:

1. Make a great local food finding app
   1. It fixes finding good Asian food w bad service
   2. It fixes not showing places w/good service but just "ok" food
   3. It potentially lets you search across delivery services
   4. It potentially lets you explore map nicely without needing to search
   2. We'll focus just finding "by dish" first, especially focusing by being great at often-missed cuisines (Asian)
   3. How we'll narrow it further:
     - Focus only on SF to start (can expand to other big cities after)
     - Built only an iPhone app (can expand to android after)
2. For growth/marketing:
   1. Save about $30-40k for ad spend once ready
      1. cancelyelp.com may be our best play there + billboards + some social
   2. Build a website that we can publish content on
      1. Generated or contractor-written highly SEO optimized Listicles
      2. Data-driven insight posts on our beautiful map if we can
      3. ? Think of other good "content verticals"

In terms of tech, we'll need to work another month to two max to really get a feel for where we are, how confident we feel on where we can get to.

Here's what we've roughly talked about doing:

1. iOS App with one screen for: Map, Search, Explore Dishes (needs a lot)
2. Backend that crawls a wide variety of things for powering apps
3. Vet a lot of things difficulty:
   1. (crawling, search, map/exploration, filtering, ratings accuracy, images)

Marketing / Growth

Lets not just pay lip service here. I think we need to do three things:

1. Actually have a high quality app (ie: back up your shit talk), so we can:
2. Generate some "news" by taking some shots at the obvious target (Yelp)
3. While also doing some pretty intense and separate content marketing

The way I see this going down is a "campaign" that is themed:

#cancelyelp

I know it's "negative", but lets try and keep it cheeky/comedic/smart to avoid blowback. Think - Apples 1984 campaign.

Perhaps we can think of something better, but this will be our measuring stick because I think this campaign could really attract some attention.

Again, Yelp is the company that literally had to buy "yelpsucks.com" to try and twist the facts that they absolutely were extorting people. That they got away with it is just a testament to their own ability to spin, but even in spite of that, the fact remains that Yelp just doesn't work very well for a lot of things - its everyones favorite app to bitch about.

(I know someone who worked there for quite a while in sales early on and he has some really awful things to say about they, including the fact that yes, they did absolutely pressure companies to pay for better reviews).

So, how do we do it?

Here's the general idea I have:

1. We get a domain like deleteyelp.com (got cancelyelp.com)
2. We put up a long, fun site there explaining all the ways they suck:
   1. We avoid claiming they extorted people, avoid lawsuit!
   2. They suck at asian restaurants / hole in the walls
   4. They way over-value service
   5. They make you work! It's like homework to find stuff
   6. They aren't fun or simple, they are like the Facebook
   8. Then we can boast our features
      1. Search across delivery services
      2. Find locals favorites / really authentic cuisine
3. We buy 1-3 billboards in SF:
   1. "#cancelyelp (cancelyelp.com)"
   2. something like "Yelp, but it doesnt suck @ asian food (and its actually fun to use)"
   3. Chefs + foodies are on Dish

Random note but perhaps someone like Ali Wong may actually help us out - her rant on asian restaurants is spot on and she even published an amazing spreadsheet of how to "tell" good asian food restaruants. In fact, we could even integrate some of those things somehow into Dish and advertise that:

"Everyone knows good Pho doesn't come from a place called Pho-get-about-it, why does Yelp supress authentic asian food?"

If we could prove we actually work for Ali Wongs list of restaurants I bet we could maybe even get her to endorse us somehow!

Plus, it totally plays well in that she loves "burning" things, and we can burn Yelp (playfully) on being shitty at that.

The idea here is if we can get a little buzz going - in a platful way. Virality!

---

The next question is - how do we keep that buzz going?

We can't afford to keep marketing like that, but perhaps we could figure out a number of small things we can do to keep ourselves in the news.

Slightly cheaper advertising methods like sponsoring podcasts I think are a really good next step. I think people who are techies actually cross over with foodies a lot too so a few targeted blog ad sponsors, too.

This isn't to say we are "set" on this strategy, and I'd love to find some good twists and angles here - stuff like Ali Wong is a good example where if we can get her on board then we may unlock many cascading sort of opportunities.

I also have a few really key chef friends - one who has worked at a ton of top restaurants in SF and LA, another who owns Fang restaurant in SF and won Chopped twice, and a couple others, and there's perhaps a way we could get them on board too and have them connect us with people.

Finally - Instagram. Instagram is a very obvious huge channel for us because it's where foodies originally went. Maybe they don't now (just post on stories), but I also have a good friend who is really well connected here too and he would do a big favor for us, so we can basically try and think of a way to get some virality here.
