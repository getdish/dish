Starting on some blog post ideas in the repo (before was just in collected notes).

Some pitches that resonate:

---

Be a food expert, without the legwork.

It's your pokedex for food, finding you amazing spots and dishes, and building a database of your favorites.

Food is incredible. Many cities are undergoing an explosion of authentic global cuisine, but our platforms fail us:

- Yelp requires serious legwork to understand if a place is "really good", and the ratings totally miss hole in the walls and authentic cuisine.

- Google just focuses on one thing - not pissing off advertisers. So while they actually have ok ratings (not the best), if you search "burger" in san francisco you get this:

  - Big Mouth (4.2)
  - Hi-Way (4.5)
  - Burger King (3.4)
  - Burger Join (4.0)
  - Popsons (4.2)
  - Whiz (4.3)
  - Super Duper (4.5)

Why is Super Duper last on that list? Why is Burger King so high? Dish cares about showing you the absolute best in a city, that's our raison de etre. Unlike Google, we can focus on a narrow use case and really be opinionated.

- FourSquare basically stopped development and left us with no great community for local discovery and no great app for documenting your travels. We'd like to make a beautiful app for your explorations.

So basically - we want something personal, fun, and with great data analysis. It should feel like your own little polished pokedex - giving you really great recommendations, every time. Letting you see what's good in any city. And letting you build a map of your adventures and follow interesting popups and new places without creepy tracking all over.

Finally - it should have some features that are missing from one or all other food apps:

- Ratings per-dish!
- Fast search across all delivery services
- Diet filters that make sense for food: vegan, keto, raw, etc
- Rate/snap a dish with a tap. Automatically builds your map.
- Great images - we want to find the "ideal" image based on your search, so if you seek a Burger you can really easily compare the burgers at a glance
