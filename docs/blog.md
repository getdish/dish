A middle-ground for food delivery

Dish is a food search engine. We started it out of frustration with the flow of finding good food, and getting it delivered. In creating it, we talked to a ton of restaurants, and during COVID, we began noticing trends - in the real world, and in our conversations with restaurant owners.

## Restaurant owners are willing to do more work, to make more money

Restaurants already have slim margins. The last thing they need is 30% coming off the top for delivery.

In talking with them we tried to find conditions that would make delivery better for them. We started with a question:

> What if we could allow restaurants to do delivery - in a way that suits their needs - with far less overhead?

Here's how we think it can work:

1. Let restaurants control their delivery constraints

Many owners told us something like this: we'd happily start doing in-house delivery, but it's tricky to get right. If we had a lot more control over _availaibility_, we could make it work.

In practice: Dish lets restaurants set delivery windows, turning on and off their delivery availability as they please. They can have pre-order conditions, or next-day delivery. They can set more restrictive minimum orders.

2. Help restaurants build their delivery staff

A common piece of feedback was that many restaurants are _already looking to do their own delivery_, but it wasn't easy to figure out.

So, we set out to find out the best practice - and [wrote a master guide on how to hire, manage, and master setting up in-house delivery for restaurants]().

3. They can handle it - so give them a big cut

Plain and simple: the food industry is cut-throat. Restaurant managers are tired of getting ripped off, and they do get nickel and dimed at every step.

But here's the thing:

- Restaurants already manage staff.
- They hire, fire, keep schedules, and understand peak hours and off hours.
- They do support - typically with a phone system and "front-desk" staff
- Adding delivery, if done at their own pace, is primarily doing "more of the same", beyond insurance, order-processing, and some metis.

## Dish is the Shopify of food delivery

So, that's it: 5% total take for Dish, which includes payment processing fees. We provide a unified experience, with easy payment, search across every delivery service, and rock solid ratings that actually try and show you (down to the dish) what's good.

Restaurants get total control, [guides]() that help them set up delivery, and most importantly - a chance actually expand their business by keeping their earnings while still delivering their food.

## Potential downsides

Dish is a food search engine. We started it because we were frustrated with how difficult it was to go through the _whole flow_ of desiring something to actually finding it.

A typical, frustrating flow I was encountering in the months after shutting down my last company: crave some Pho. Search for Pho on Uber Eats. Find a couple restaurants. Yelp those restaurants (spend 5 minutes on each one, scrolling through reviews to see if its the service or the ambiance that caused mediocre ratings). Eventually just search Yelp for Pho, find the best looking places. Then go back into Postmates, Caviar, and GrubHub and search for those restaurants. Usually a few steps involved finding the actual restaurant, but then seeing that the delivery price was too high, so restarting the search again. Usually, the search would end early. I'd find some place that was good enough and stick with it. If it was closed? Well, back to step 1.

It doesn't need to be this way. So we built Dish. Dish:

- Aggregates all food delivery services.
- Aggregates 8 different food rating services, then uses modern NLP to separate out reviews that are obviously mentioning service or ambiance, or reviews that hone in on specific dishes.
- Crawls restaurant Instagrams and websites for better images, menus, and local events like pop-ups or new menu items.
- Is a modern, light, fast app

Be a food expert, without the legwork.

It's your pokedex for food, finding you amazing spots and dishes, and building a database of your favorites.

Food is incredible. Many cities are undergoing an explosion of authentic global cuisine, but our platforms fail us:

- Yelp requires serious legwork to understand if a place is "really good", and the ratings totally miss hole in the walls and authentic cuisine.

- Google just focuses on one thing - not pissing off advertisers. So while they actually have ok ratings (not the best), if you search "burger" in san francisco you get this:

  - Big Mouth (4.2)
  - Hi-Way (4.5)
  - Burger King (3.4)
  - Burger Join (4.0)
  - Popsons (4.2)
  - Whiz (4.3)
  - Super Duper (4.5)

Why is Super Duper last on that list? Why is Burger King so high? Dish cares about showing you the absolute best in a city, that's our raison de etre. Unlike Google, we can focus on a narrow use case and really be opinionated.

- FourSquare basically stopped development and left us with no great community for local discovery and no great app for documenting your travels. We'd like to make a beautiful app for your explorations.

So basically - we want something personal, fun, and with great data analysis. It should feel like your own little polished pokedex - giving you really great recommendations, every time. Letting you see what's good in any city. And letting you build a map of your adventures and follow interesting popups and new places without creepy tracking all over.

Finally - it should have some features that are missing from one or all other food apps:

- Ratings per-dish!
- Fast search across all delivery services
- Diet filters that make sense for food: vegan, keto, raw, etc
- Rate/snap a dish with a tap. Automatically builds your map.
- Great images - we want to find the "ideal" image based on your search, so if you seek a Burger you can really easily compare the burgers at a glance
